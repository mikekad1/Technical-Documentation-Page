       The UK was a cradle of the first wave of heavy metal, which was born at the end of the 1960s and flowered in the early 1970s.[11] Of the many British bands that came to prominence during that period, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple achieved worldwide success and critical acclaim.[12] The success of the music genre, usually called heavy rock at the time,[13] generated a community of UK fans with strong ties to psychedelia, hippie doctrines and biker subculture.[14] Each of these bands was in crisis in the mid-to-late 1970s: Led Zeppelin were plagued by discord and personal tragedies and had drastically reduced their activities,[15] Black Sabbath finally fired their charismatic but unreliable frontman Ozzy Osbourne,[16] and Deep Purple disbanded.[17] As a consequence, the whole movement lost much of its momentum and media interest, which were refocused on what British writer Malc Macmillan calls "the more fashionable or lucrative markets of the day" such as disco, glam, mod revival, new wave and electronic music.[18] Just like progressive rock acts and other mainstream music groups of the 1970s, heavy rock bands were viewed as – in the words of journalist Garry Bushell – "lumbering dinosaurs" by a music press infatuated with punk rock and new wave.[19] Some writers even declared the premature demise of heavy metal altogether.[20]

        The crisis of British heavy rock giants left space for the rise of other rock bands in the mid-1970s,[21] including Queen,[22] Hawkwind,[23] Budgie,[24] Bad Company,[25] Status Quo[26] and Nazareth,[27] all of which had multiple chart entries in the UK and had conducted successful international tours.[28] The British chart results of the period show that there was still a vast audience for heavy metal in the country, and upcoming bands Thin Lizzy,[29] UFO[30] and Judas Priest,[31] also had tangible success and media coverage in the late 1970s.[32] Foreign hard rock acts, such as Blue Öyster Cult and Kiss from the US,[33][34] Rush from Canada,[35] Scorpions from Germany,[36] and especially AC/DC from Australia,[37] climbed the British charts in the same period.[28]

          The band Motörhead was founded in 1975 by already experienced musicians.[39] Their leader Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister was a former member of the space rock band Hawkwind,[40] Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies,[41] and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus.[42] Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal.[43] Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene.[43][44] Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions program[45] and the first to reach No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith in June 1981.[44] Lemmy himself said, "the NWOBHM ... didn't do us much good", because Motörhead "came along a bit too early for it".[46]

          Other critics view Motörhead as the first significant exponent of the movement[47] and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal.[48] Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans.[48] Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour,[49] and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends' punk band The Damned.[50] Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.[51]

      <p>The NWOBHM involved both musicians and fans who were largely young, male and white and shared class origin, ethic and aesthetic values.[52] American sociologist Deena Weinstein, in her book Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture, describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years.[53] British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas,[54] metalheads,[55] or headbangers for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads in time to the music,[56] dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from the counterculture of the 1960s[57] and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s,[58] updating the shared principles and codes of the heavy metal subculture[59] and definitely separating it from mainstream society.[60]</p>

        Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest were already playing international arenas,[145] when new heavy metal bands, composed of very young people, debuted in small venues in many cities in the UK.[8] The country's larger venues were usually reserved for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered much less profitable.[146] Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs, pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a local fan base and enabled them to come in contact with managers and record label agents.[147]

       Angel Witch, Iron Maiden, Praying Mantis and Samson from London,[148] Son of a Bitch (later Saxon) from Barnsley,[129] Diamond Head from Stourbridge,[149] Marseille from Liverpool,[150] White Spirit from Hartlepool,[151] Witchfynde from Derbyshire,[152] Vardis from Wakefield,[153] Def Leppard from Sheffield,[154] Raven and Tygers of Pan Tang from around Newcastle,[155] and Holocaust from Edinburgh[156] were the most important metal bands founded between 1975 and 1977 that animated the club scene in their respective cities and towns.[157] The first bands of the newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits, often causing clubs to specialise, presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock.[158] Differences in ideology, attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between the two audiences.[159] What punk and NWOBHM musicians had in common was their "do-it-yourself" attitude toward the music business and the consequent practice of self-production and self-distribution of recorded material in the form of audio cassette demos, or privately pressed singles, aimed initially at local supporters.[5]

        It also led to the birth and diffusion of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases.[160] Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.[161]

      The NWOBHM triggered a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding a legion of typically mediocre musicians.[308] Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal[309] and included no classic rock recordings.[308] Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand.[310] The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM is now seen as key to the diversification of heavy metal in the second half of the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s.[311] The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal,[312] just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom[d] generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America.[313] Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and several minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.[314]
